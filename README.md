# FloodHack Jakarta 2016 Sandpit

This is just a simple test project to run a simulation using AnuGA on a part of Ciliwung river in the area of Jakarta. The simulation setup is very basic and has probably nothing to do with reality :-)

The script is able to produce two hypothetical cases (the model simulates five hours of flooding):

- one with normal flow of flood water: see video https://vid.me/7Kwd
- the other one with artificially added water gate: see video https://vid.me/T1vL

Two cases: original DEM and DEM with artificially added closed water gate
